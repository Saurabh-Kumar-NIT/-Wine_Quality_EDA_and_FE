Project Title: Red Wine Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
Project Overview:
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the Red Wine Quality dataset, which contains various chemical properties of red wine and their corresponding quality ratings. The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, understand relationships between features, and identify patterns that influence wine quality. Additionally, the project includes a robust Feature Engineering process to enhance the dataset and improve the accuracy of machine learning models in predicting wine quality.

Key Objectives:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and examine the relationships between different chemical properties and wine quality.
Visualized key trends and patterns using various plotting techniques, including histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices, and pair plots.
Analyzed the impact of individual features on the quality rating, with a focus on identifying significant contributors to high and low-quality wines.
Feature Engineering:

Developed new features based on domain knowledge and insights gained during the EDA phase.
Engineered features such as combined acidity, alcohol-to-density ratio, and others to capture more complex relationships within the data.
Performed feature scaling and normalization to ensure that the data is well-prepared for machine learning algorithms.
Assessed the importance of features using correlation analysis and feature importance techniques.
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
Applied appropriate transformations to the data, including log transformations and polynomial features, to enhance model performance.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring a balanced distribution of quality ratings across both sets.
Machine Learning Readiness:

Prepared the dataset for machine learning by selecting relevant features, normalizing data, and creating target labels.
Provided insights into which features are most likely to improve predictive accuracy when used in machine learning models.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 1,599 observations of red wines, each with 11 chemical properties such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, and alcohol content, along with a quality score ranging from 0 to 10.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Data Visualization: Detailed visualizations to illustrate key findings and relationships within the data.
Jupyter Notebook: Used for interactive analysis and documentation of the entire process.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of EDA and Feature Engineering techniques to a real-world dataset, showcasing the process of transforming raw data into a form suitable for predictive modeling. The insights and engineered features derived from this analysis can serve as a strong foundation for developing machine learning models aimed at predicting wine quality.
